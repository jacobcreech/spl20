## SPL20

**Solana tokens are different than Ethereum tokens**

ERC20 consists of an interface standard meant for anyone to use. Due to the way the Solana account model is setup, there are more benefits to having a single Token smart contract on Solana. This repository consists of an example of what SPL-Token on Solana is written in Solidity

*Note:* This contract is obviously not audited and written in a short timespan. The gas usage on it is likely inefficient.
